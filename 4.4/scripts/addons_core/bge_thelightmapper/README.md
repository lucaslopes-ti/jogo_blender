â„¹ Note: I'm slowly making a new and improved version of the Lightmapper. It's currently located in the "Lightmapper-One" branch, but keep in mind, it's very early and WIP - Naxela.

## The Lightmapper

![](img/a.png)

### Description

The Lightmapper is an addon for Blender that implements lightmapping and denoising capabilities for global illumination texture baking with support for 32-bit HDR Lightmaps. 
Baking is done through Cycles, and includes automatic material setup, automatic UV setup, encoding options, format options and advanced postprocess filtering. The setup is object-centric, meaning that you can customize the settings for each individual object, providing you with the easiest and most versatile lightmapping solution for Blender.

### Features - Version 0.3
- Automated lightmap baking

The addon automates everything you need to bake, ranging from scaling, material setup, uv-layering, uv-unwrapping and more:

- Per-object settings

Each object can have it's own settings and be customized in terms of resolution, uv margin and unwrap mode:

- Multi-material support

Add as many materials to each object as you want:

- AI-based Denoising

Integrated denoising as well as support for faster CPU OIDN denoising and GPU Optix denoising:

- Performance and speed

Baking presets automatically adjusts sampling, quality and tile settings based on situation and CPU/GPU:

- Postprocess filtering

Additional filtering to give your lightmaps an extra edge and quality through OpenCV:

- Background-baking

Is your baking going to take a long time? Try background baking, which let's you continue working on your scene:

- Easy material management

Apart from automatic material setup, resetting materials is easy and baking without material setup too for external engines:

### Installation

Installation of The Lightmapper is straight forward. All you need to do is download the latest release, and install as a .zip file from inside Blender. For more information, please refer to the wiki section: COMING SOON

### Usage

To lightmap, the scene needs to be saved to disk.

To enable lightmapping for single objects, go to object properties/The Lightmapper and enable it.

If you want to bake the whole scene, you can enable lightmapping for all objects by going to Utilities and click "Enable for set" - By default it will apply this to all the objects in the scene.
